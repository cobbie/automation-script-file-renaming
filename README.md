This script was created to rename all .mp4 & .srt files among multiple directories containing various videos and subtitle tracks.

Originally, the files, both .mp4 and .srt, had file names beginning with the same numbers i.e. '12 - Lesson 12.mp4' and '12 -Lesson 12.srt' - which made the file arrangement in Finder or File Explorer unpleasant. 

This script auto-renames the files such that all .srt files begin with 'sub_' - which segregates all the .srt files and puts them below the last .mp4 file in the directory, making it easy to navigate and scan through .mp4 files.

The main directory this was tested on successfully transformed over 500 files among over 25 directories.
